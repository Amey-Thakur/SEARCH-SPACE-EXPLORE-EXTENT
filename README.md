<!-- OVERVIEW -->
<a name="overview"></a>
## Overview

**Search Space | Explore Extent** represents a pivotal milestone as my **First Web Design Project**. Developed during the early phases of my engineering journey, this project focuses on the practical application of core web technologies, HTML5 and CSS3, to create a visually engaging and responsive multi-page website.

The project explores themes of astronomy and galactic exploration, utilizing a dark-themed aesthetic with cosmic imagery, vibrant accents, and smooth interactive elements to enhance the user experience.

> [!TIP]
> **Design Consistency**
>
> The project utilizes a centralized `style.css` to maintain visual harmony across `index.html`, `galaxy.html`, and `about.html`. Modular CSS encourages reusability and ensures that design tokens (colors, typography, spacing) remain consistent across the entire application layer.

- **Environment**: No server-side runtime is required; this is a static client-side application.

> [!WARNING]
> **Local Execution**
>
> While the project can be executed by opening `index.html` directly, certain features (like embedded maps or external fonts) may require an active internet connection to resolve correctly.

### 2. Setup & Deployment
1.  **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Amey-Thakur/SEARCH-SPACE-EXPLORE-EXTENT.git
    cd SEARCH-SPACE-EXPLORE-EXTENT
    ```
2.  **Launch**:
    Open `Source Code/index.html` in your preferred browser.
